# Credit Score Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a credit score classification model. The project aims to classify individuals into various credit score categories based on financial and demographic features, helping financial institutions assess creditworthiness.

## Project Overview

Credit score classification is essential for managing financial risk and determining loan eligibility. This model leverages machine learning algorithms to classify credit scores into categories such as Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor. Using historical data and relevant features, it provides an efficient and automated way to predict credit scores.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data, handling missing values and normalizing financial metrics to optimize model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Selects key features that have the highest impact on credit score prediction, ensuring model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Classification Model**: Trains a machine learning classifier to categorize individuals into different credit score bands, providing a structured credit assessment tool.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
2. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook, load the dataset, and execute each cell to preprocess the data, train the model, and view classification results.

## Applications

This credit score classification tool can assist financial institutions in making informed credit decisions, improve customer segmentation, and support risk management strategies.

## Future Directions

Further enhancements may include testing with additional machine learning models, integrating feature engineering techniques, and applying deep learning for potentially higher accuracy.
